DESCRIPTION

  Origami is a framework written in Ruby designed to parse, analyze, and forge
  PDF documents. This is not a PDF rendering library, it aims at providing a
  scripting tool for generating and analyzing malicious PDF files. As well, it
  can be used to create on-the-fly customized PDFs, or to inject evil code into
  already existing documents.
